Building is currently set up to work in Windows using GCC and Visual Studio 2008/2010

Running "build.py" will build object files and the executable.
Target settings are specified on the command line; see "build.all.bat" for all combinations.
Additionally, "run" can be specified to run it after compilation.

"settings.py" contains the directories specific files are located in.
Modify the directory values inside of it to the directories on your system.

Additionally, when compiling with Visual Studio 2008, the files from "other\inttypes.zip"
must be be extracted into an included directory. (e.g. "...\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\include")
